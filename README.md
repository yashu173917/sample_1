Hero:

The man known to be the greatest man alive 

In a world where boundaries define the game, one man redefines them. 
AB de Villiers—fearless, fluid, unstoppable. Every shot he plays bends the laws of possibility, every moment on the crease feels like a script written for the extraordinary.He doesn't just play cricket—he rewrites what it means to be human with a bat in hand.

“He rose like dawn, conquered like destiny, and vanished into history—leaving the game itself to wander forever in his shadow.”
